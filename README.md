DGI for Anti-Money Laundering
Exam project for the 2022/23 course in Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies at UNIBO 

This work aims to present a new way to study Bitcoin transactions utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in order to detect illicit activities on the blockchain environment. We show how the Deep Graph Infomax (DGI) embeddings allow us to obtain better results in finding illicit transactions when paired with standard classification methods like Random Forest (RF).
The studied algorithms have been trained and tested on the Elliptic Data Set, the main data source for this kind of applications. In the folder "Papers" you can find all the articles and/or papers that have been used to develop this solution.
